# Income Prediction: A 3-Month Forecasting Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts a company's income three months ahead using historical financial data. The predictive model leverages advanced time series forecasting techniques to provide actionable insights for financial planning and decision-making.

## Features
- Accurate three-month income forecasting.
- Advanced time series modeling using **[LSTM, ARIMA, etc.]**.
- Visualization of historical trends and predicted values.
- Scalable solution for financial forecasting.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Data Description
The dataset consists of monthly income records, including:
- Historical revenue data.


Data was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure stationarity.

## Model and Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed historical trends and seasonal patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created lag features and rolling statistics.



## Usage
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parvanerezaeeaims/parvanerezaeeaims-Income-Prediction-A-3-Month-Forecasting-Project.git
```

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional external factors like market trends or macroeconomic indicators.
- Extend the model for longer-term forecasting.
- Deploy the solution as a web app or API for broader accessibility.
